### Code example

**Matrix creation kata from CODEWARS:** *Create an identity matrix of the specified size( >= 0).*

*Some examples:*
```
(1)  =>  [[1]]

(2) => [ [1,0],
         [0,1] ]

       [ [1,0,0,0,0],
         [0,1,0,0,0],
(5) =>   [0,0,1,0,0],
         [0,0,0,1,0],
         [0,0,0,0,1] ]   
```

*My solution:*

```javascript
function getMatrix(number) {
  let matrix = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    let row = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < number; j++) {
      row.unshift(j === i ? 1 : 0);
    }
    matrix.unshift(row);
  }
  return matrix;
} 
```
